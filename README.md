# Coinranx

This is a next js project created to display cryptocurrency data in a simple interface. All the data is fetched from Coingecko's free API.

## Features
- Displays Top 100 coins sorted by market capacity.
- Favourites can be bookmarked and viewed separately.
- Displays specific coin data with 7d price data in a line graph.

> Note: This project was created for me to practice web development using react.
